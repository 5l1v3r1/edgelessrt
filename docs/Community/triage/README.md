Triage
======

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage

    Triage is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments
    based on the severity of their condition or likelihood of recovery with and
    without treatment.

How We Do It
------------

As implemented within the Open Enclave SDK project, triage is the process of
classifying incoming issues and PRs, ensuring the appropriate tags are assigned,
the right SIGs notice the work item, and the work can be aligned to the project
release cycle. A weekly triage meeting provides regular touch-point for
development cycle alignment and ensures that no new-contributor issue goes
untouched for too long.

*Note(Aeva) we don't currently have a process to measure or track issue health
**after triage** to ensure that issues do not become stale ... but we should*

Meetings
--------
Triage meetings are open to everyone. If you have recently filed an issue or a PR, you may want to attend the next triage meeting and help with classification.
**Regular Triage meeting**: Weekly on Mondays at 11:00 PT (Pacific Time) *meeting link TBD* [(convert to your local timezone)](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=11:00&tz=PT%20%28Pacific%20Time%29)
