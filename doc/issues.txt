    (*) Does GCC provide stack protection schemes?

    (*) Can the host set aside some memory when making an ECALL that
        enclave can use when making subsequence OCALLS. Kind of scratch
        area? We should know the size of the parameters.

    (*) Should enclaves be able to create threads?

    (*) Can enclaves safely allocate space on the host stack during an OCALL?

    (*) Should ORET be assigned the same TCS as the original ECALL used?

    (*) Should HostMalloc() guard against subsequent ECALLs. So can we
        implement a non-reentrant flag?

    (*) Do we need to dynamically expand TSD slots (TLS).
