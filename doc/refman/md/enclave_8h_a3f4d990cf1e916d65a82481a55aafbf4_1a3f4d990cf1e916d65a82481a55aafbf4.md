# OE_CallHost()

Perform an outside function call (or OCALL) into the host.

## Syntax

    OE_CallHost(
        const char * func,
        void * args);
## Description 

Call the host function named **func** **args** passing it the  parameter. The host must provide a host function with the following signature.

```
OE_OCALL void MyHostFunction(void* args);
```



The meaning of the **args** parameter is defined by the OCALL implementation and might be null for some implementations.

At the software layer, this function sends an **OCALL** message to the host and waits for an **ORET** message. Note that the OCALL implementation may call back into the enclave (an ECALL) before returning.

At the hardware layer, this function executes the **ENCLU.EEXIT** instruction to leave the enclave and enter the host. When the host returns from the ECALL, it executes the **ENCLU.EENTER** instruction to reenter the enclave.

Note that the return value only indicates whether the OCALL was called and not whether it was successful. The OCALL implementation must define its own error reporting scheme based on the **args** parameter.
