# OE_CondWait()

Waits on a condition variable.

## Syntax

    int OE_CondWait(
        cond,
        mutex);
## Description 

A thread calls this function to wait on a condition variable. If the condition variable is available, OE_CondWait() returns immediately. Otherwise, the thread is placed on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue where it waits to be signaled. The **mutex** parameter is used to synchronize access to the condition variable. The caller locks this mutex before calling OE_CondWait(), which places the thread on the waiting queue and unlocks the mutex. When the thread is signaled by OE_CondSignal(), the waiting thread acquires the mutex and returns.

In enclaves, this function performs an OCALL, where the thread waits to be signaled.



## Parameters

#### cond

Wait on this condition variable.

#### mutex

This mutex must be locked by the caller.

## Returns

Returns zero on success.
