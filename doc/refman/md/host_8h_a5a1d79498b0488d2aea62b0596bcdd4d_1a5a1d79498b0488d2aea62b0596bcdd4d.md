# OE_CallEnclave()

Perform an enclave function call (or ECALL) into the enclave.

## Syntax

    OE_Result OE_CallEnclave(
        OE_Enclave *enclave,
        const char *func,
        void *args);
## Description 

Call the enclave function named **func**, passing it the  parameter. The enclave must provide a function with the following signature.

The meaning of the **args** parameter is defined by the ECALL implementation and might be null for some implementations.

At the software layer, this function sends an **ECALL** message to the enclave and waits for an  message. Note that the ECALL implementation may call back into the host (an OCALL) before returning.

At the hardware layer, this function executes the **ENCLU.EENTER** instruction to enter the enclave. When the enclave returns from the ECALL, it executes the  instruction exit the enclave and to resume host execution.

Note that the return value only indicates whether the ECALL was called and not whether it was successful. The ECALL implementation must define its own error reporting scheme based on the **args** parameter.

## Parameters

#### func

#### args

## Return value

#### OE_OK

#### OE_FAILED
