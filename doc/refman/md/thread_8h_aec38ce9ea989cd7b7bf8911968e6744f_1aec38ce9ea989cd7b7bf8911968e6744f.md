# OE_CondSignal()

Signal a thread waiting on a condition variable.

## Syntax

    int OE_CondSignal(
        cond);
## Description 

A thread calls this function to signal the next thread waiting on the given condition variable. Waiting threads call OE_CondWait() which places them on on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue, where they wait to be signaled. OE_CondSignal() wakes up the thread at the front of queue, causing it to return from OE_CondWait().

In enclaves, this function performs an OCALL, where it wakes the next waiting thread.



## Parameters

#### cond

Signal this condition variable.

## Returns

Returns zero on success.
