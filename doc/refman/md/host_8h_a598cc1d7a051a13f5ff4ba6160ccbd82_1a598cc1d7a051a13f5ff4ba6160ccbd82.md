## Description 

This function creates an enclave from an enclave image file. While creating the enclave, this function interacts with the Intel(R) SGX drviver and the Intel(R) AESM service. Enclave creation peforms the following steps.

- Loads an enclave image file into memory
- Builds the enclave's image layout in memory
- Asks the driver to create the enclave (ECREATE)
- Asks the driver to add each page of the enclave (EADD/EEXTEND)
- Asks the Intel(R) launch enclave (LE) for a launch token (EINITKEY)
- Asks the driver to initialize the enclave with the token (EINIT)

Once these steps have been performed, the enclave is ready to use.
