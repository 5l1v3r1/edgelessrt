# OE_CreateEnclave()

Creates an enclave from an enclave image file.

## Syntax

    OE_Result OE_CreateEnclave(const char *path, uint32_t flags, OE_Enclave **enclave)
## Description 

This function creates an enclave from an enclave image file. While creating the enclave, this function interacts with the Intel(R) SGX drviver and the Intel(R) AESM service. Enclave creation peforms the following steps.

- Loads an enclave image file

- Maps the enclave memory image onto the driver device (/dev/isgx)

- Lays out the enclave memory image and injects metadata

- Asks the driver to create the enclave (ECREATE)

- Asks the driver to add the pages to the EPC (EADD/EEXTEND)

- Asks the Intel(R) launch enclave (LE) for a launch token (EINITKEY)

- Asks the driver to initialize the enclave with the token (EINIT)

Once these steps have been performed, the enclave is ready to use.



## Parameters

#### path

The path of an enclave image file in ELF-64 format. This file must have been linked with the **oeenclave** library and signed by the **oesign** tool.

#### flags

These flags control how the enclave is run.

- OE_FLAG_DEBUG - runs the enclave in debug mode

- OE_FLAG_SIMULATION - runs the enclave in simulation mode

#### enclave

This points to the enclave instance upon succeess.

## Returns

Returns OE_OK on success.
